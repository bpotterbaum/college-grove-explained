## Why Doesn’t College Grove Have Restaurants or Coffee Shops?

It’s a question almost everyone who lives in—or visits—College Grove eventually asks. And it’s a fair one, especially given how close we are to Franklin, Nolensville, and Murfreesboro.

The short answer: it’s **not** a lack of interest, demand, or community support.

College Grove doesn’t have restaurants or coffee shops primarily because of **infrastructure**, not zoning or culture:

- There is **no public sewer system**
- Most properties rely on **septic systems**, which are poorly suited for restaurants
- **Local soil conditions** often can’t support commercial-scale septic at all
- Current regulations allow only **very limited wastewater alternatives**
- Zoning can allow small commercial uses, but **wastewater—not zoning—is the real constraint**

This isn’t about opposition to growth or a preference for staying rural at all costs.

It mostly comes down to one unglamorous but critical issue:  
**where the wastewater goes.**

## The Core Issue: Wastewater

Restaurants and coffee shops generate **far more wastewater** than homes — especially wastewater that contains:

- Grease
- Food solids
- Detergents
- High organic load

In cities, that wastewater goes into a **public sewer system**.

In College Grove, there is **no public sewer**.

Instead, properties must use **on-site septic systems**.

### Why That’s a Problem

According to Williamson County’s own planning documents:

> “Much of the area cannot support traditional septic systems due to unsuitable soils, and there is no public sewer system available.”
>
> — *College Grove Village Special Area Plan*

That alone is enough to stop most restaurant projects before they start.

## Why Septic Systems Don’t Work Well for Restaurants

### 1. Soil Limitations

Large portions of College Grove sit on:

- Shallow soils
- Clay-heavy soils
- Poorly draining soils

These conditions make it difficult — and sometimes impossible — to install septic drain fields that meet health standards.

Williamson County’s septic rules require specific soil performance to approve any system:

Many lots in the village core simply **don’t qualify**.

---

### 2. Restaurants Create “High-Strength Waste”

County and state regulations classify restaurant wastewater as **high-strength waste**, which means:

- It **cannot** be treated like residential wastewater
- It typically requires **advanced treatment systems**
- It often requires **much more land** for disposal

Williamson County currently limits where and how those advanced systems can be used:
https://www.williamsoncounty-tn.gov/DocumentCenter/View/732785257595584

For small village lots, those requirements are often impossible to meet.

---

### 3. No Shared or Community Wastewater System

Some rural communities solve this by using:

- Shared septic systems
- Cluster wastewater systems
- Small community treatment facilities

College Grove **does not currently have one**.

The County’s own planning documents note that while these systems are theoretically possible, they have **never been built in the village**:
https://www.williamsoncounty-tn.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1403

Without shared infrastructure, each restaurant would need to solve wastewater **entirely on its own** — which is rarely feasible.

---

## What About Water Service?

College Grove *does* have public water through the **Nolensville / College Grove Utility District (NCGUD)** — but even that has limits.

NCGUD does not produce its own water. It purchases water from other utilities under capped agreements:

While water alone doesn’t stop restaurants, it adds another layer of planning complexity for higher-use businesses.

---

## Is Zoning the Problem?

Surprisingly: **not really**.

College Grove *does* have a designated **Village zoning district**, which allows small-scale commercial uses intended to preserve historic character:
https://www.tranzon.com/otherdocs/zoning_ordinance_09112023_202309121530040463_17301.pdf

Buildings are limited in size and scale — but **restaurants and cafés are not outright banned**.

In practice, zoning is secondary.  
Most projects fail **before zoning even matters**, because they can’t pass wastewater approval.

---

## Why Private Communities Can Have Restaurants (But the Public Can’t)

This is an important distinction.

Large private developments — like **The Grove** — were able to:

- Build private wastewater treatment systems
- Dedicate large areas of land for disposal
- Spread costs across hundreds of homes

That level of infrastructure investment isn’t realistic for a single independent café or restaurant.

So while restaurants *exist* in College Grove, they are:
- Private
- Members-only
- Backed by subdivision-scale infrastructure

---

## Is This Permanent?

No — but change is slow.

Williamson County is currently reviewing its septic and wastewater rules through a formal task force process, with recommendations expected in **2026**:
https://www.williamsoncounty-tn.gov/DocumentCenter/View/753572683733882

Longer-term regional water planning is also underway:
https://malloryvalley.municipalone.com/document/45971

These efforts could eventually make **shared or modern wastewater systems** more realistic — which is the key missing piece.
