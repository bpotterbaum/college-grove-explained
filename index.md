# Why doesn’t College Grove have restaurants or coffee shops?

## Short answer
Mostly **wastewater constraints** (septic), not lack of demand.

## The practical reality
Much of College Grove is **unincorporated** and does **not** have a public sanitary sewer system. Many properties rely on **on-site wastewater** (septic).

Food service uses (restaurants, coffee shops with sinks/ice makers/dishwashing/food prep) can create:
- higher wastewater volumes than typical residential use
- grease/food-related wastewater that often requires **grease traps** and additional controls
- “peak load” patterns that are harder for small on-site systems to handle

Even when zoning and community interest exist, projects can stall at the wastewater approval stage because:
- the site’s soils may not support a standard drainfield
- an existing/older system may be under-sized for a more intensive use
- upgrades or alternative systems can become expensive or infeasible for a small business

## What this is NOT saying
This page does not argue for or against growth. It only summarizes common constraints that affect small commercial uses in a community without public sewer infrastructure.
